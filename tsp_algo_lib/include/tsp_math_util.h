 * 1. Calculates the cost of all edges that will be removed from the original tour
 * 2. Calculates the cost of all new edges that will be added to form the new tour
 * 3. Returns the difference (delta) between these costs

 * Salesperson Problem (TSP).

 * Note that the first edge in the original tour is removed as part of this operation,
